First step: Create openssl.conf with params (for example): 
=======================================
[req]
default_bits = 2048
prompt = no
default_md = sha256
distinguished_name = dn

[dn]
C = US
ST = State
L = City
O = Organization
OU = Organization Unit
CN = localhost

[v3_ca]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = localhost
IP.1 = 127.0.0.1
========================

You can valid your file this command:
openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text -noout / openssl req -text -noout -verify -in req.pem 

Step 2: 
Verify ur rsa with this commnad: 
openssl rsa -in key.pem -check

Step 3: 
Verify ur MD5 this command 
openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in cert.pem | openssl md5
openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in key.pem | openssl md5

If is okey that had been done
